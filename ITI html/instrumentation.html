                                ITI Instrumentation Trade is a vocational training course offered by Industrial Training
                                Institutes (ITIs) in India. The course provides students with practical skills in
                                instrumentation technology and equips them for the role of an instrumentation technician
                                or engineer. The duration of the course is usually two years and covers various topics
                                related to instrumentation technology.

                                The ITI Instrumentation Trade course is designed to provide students with theoretical
                                and practical knowledge of instrumentation technology. The course covers topics such as
                                measurement techniques, control systems, process control, and instrumentation systems.
                                The students are also trained in safety procedures, calibration procedures, and
                                installation of instrumentation equipment.

                                The course curriculum includes both theoretical and practical aspects, which provide
                                students with hands-on experience in instrumentation technology. The students are taught
                                using modern technologies and tools, which enable them to learn the latest trends in the
                                industry. The faculty is highly qualified and experienced, and the teaching
                                methodologies are designed to enable students to learn at their own pace.
