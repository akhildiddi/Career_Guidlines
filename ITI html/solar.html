                                ITI Solar Trade is a vocational training course offered by Industrial Training
                                Institutes (ITIs) in India. The course is designed to provide students with practical
                                skills in the installation, maintenance, and repair of solar panels and systems. With
                                the increasing demand for clean energy, solar technology is becoming increasingly
                                important, making the ITI Solar Trade course an excellent option for students who want
                                to pursue a career in the renewable energy industry.

                                The ITI Solar Trade course is a two-year program that covers various topics related to
                                solar technology. The course curriculum includes theoretical and practical aspects,
                                enabling students to learn about solar panels, solar inverters, batteries, and charge
                                controllers. The students are also trained in safety procedures, equipment maintenance,
                                and troubleshooting solar panel problems.

                                The course content is designed to give students a comprehensive understanding of solar
                                panel installation and maintenance. The students learn about the different types of
                                solar panels, including monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film panels. They
                                also learn about the different types of solar inverters and their functions, as well as
                                the types of batteries used in solar systems.
