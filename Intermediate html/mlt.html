                                Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) is an Program offered for Allied
                                Health Sciences. Medical Laboratory Technology is an Allied Health
                                specialty concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of
                                diseases through the use of clinical laboratory tests. Though the
                                Medical Lab technologists spend less time with patients than doctors
                                and nurses, medical laboratory professionals are just as dedicated
                                to patient's health.
